## TODO:
- Domain name as parameter
- Handle when we want to get the title and get "BLOCKED" or CloudFlare'd
- Create a DEV stage
- Implement Auth (duh)
- can we use shorter links?
- Tag all resources
- Further break down stacks

## Deployment

You need to make sure to have CDK installed
`cdk bootstrap` first
